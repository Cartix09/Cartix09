Hey there,

I'm Mursal, a student with a keen interest in Business Management and the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence. I'm super excited to dive deeper into the realm of AI and explore its endless possibilities. 
Currently, I've got a good grasp of various programming languages like Python, R Studio, Scala, SQL, and Shell, but I'm hungry for more knowledge and eager to learn even more languages.

Beyond my studies, I've got a couple of hobbies that keep me going. I love hitting the trails on my mountain bike, feeling the rush of adventure in the great outdoors. On the creative side, I enjoy making small games, putting my coding skills to use in a fun and interactive way.

If you want to get in touch with me for any reason, just drop me an email at mursalhaciyev@gmail.com. I'm always open to connecting with fellow AI enthusiasts, potential collaborators, or anyone who shares my passions.

Looking forward to the journey ahead!

Warm regards,
Mursal
